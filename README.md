# Jupyter All Spark Notebook

A [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
[Jupyter notebook](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/) image with
[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/),
[PySpark 3.5.0](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.0/api/python/index.html),
[JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab), and
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) support.

## TL;DR

```shell
docker compose build
docker compose up
```
To run in the background:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

Access JupyterLab at http://localhost:8888

## Features

- **Python & PySpark**: Full data processing and analysis with Apache Spark
- **Rust Support**: Interactive Rust notebooks and Python-Rust integration via PyO3 and maturin
- **JupyterLab**: Modern notebook interface with multiple kernels

## Rust Integration

This image includes Rust support for building high-performance extensions and working with Rust alongside PySpark. See [RUST_SUPPORT.md](RUST_SUPPORT.md) for detailed documentation.
